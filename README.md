### Hugo Sibony

President & CTO at [TrueFalse](https://truefalse.fr). Cybersecurity student at EPITA, Paris. Currently hunting threats at WELAN.

Previously built TOR-like anonymization protocols at Snowpack (CEA). I break things, find vulnerabilities, and write code in C, Assembly, Python, and Go.

I like to work on side projects when I have free time. Always looking to learn more.
